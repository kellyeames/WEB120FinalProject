        <h2>Streamline Tavern: The Stranger</h2>
    
    <p>"This beloved Queen Anne dive is marked by an iconic light-up sign; inside, you'll find beer and wine and booze, a charmingly schlocky art collection (a dogs-playing-cards tapestry, a glossy poster of an '80s bodybuilding duo), and free peanuts!"<span><a href="https://www.thestranger.com/locations/178271/streamline-tavern"> Read More...</a></span></p>

        <h2>Cheap Drinks and Punk Rock at the Streamline Tavern</h2>
    
    <p>"When news came that a Korean Embassy was to be built on Mercer, ousting the Streamline from its storied location, many were upset. But fears of losing the tavern were abated when Seattleites learned that the dive bar would be moving just a few blocks away to 174 Roy Street."<span><a href="https://seattle.eater.com/2015/3/19/8257637/cheap-drinks-and-punk-rock-at-the-streamline-tavern"> Read More...</a></span></p>
        
        
        <h2>News you can eat: The Streamline Tavern is reborn, the Market Hall concept is realized, a cat cafe pops up and more</h2>
    
    <p>"Former P-I columnist Mike Lewis, his Streamline co-owner Mary McIntyre and four friends went the literal extra half-mile to keep some of the old diveâ€™s classic charm, carrying part of the central island of a bar down six blocks of sidewalk with their own hands."<span><a href="http://blogs.seattletimes.com/allyoucaneat/2015/02/19/news-you-can-eat-the-streamline-tavern-is-reborn-the-market-hall-concept-is-realized-a-cat-cafe-pops-up-and-more/"> Read More...</a></span></p>
        
        
        <h2>Happy Hours for People Who Are a Little Old Man on the Inside</h2>
    
    <p>"A lot of work went into the Streamline's preservation. Owners Mike Lewis and Mary McIntyre actually carried the original central bar island and wood paneling down the street to its new home. The tapestry of dogs playing poker I remembered from the old location was back, and pinball machines glowed in every corner. Above the pinball: a mural of the Kalakala blasting through space. During happy hour, a beer and shot are $6 and a basket of veggie sliders and fries from the downstairs kitchen are the same price."<span><a href="https://www.thestranger.com/the-stranger-s-guide-to-seattle-s-happiest-happy-hours/2016/10/17/24593586/happy-hours-for-people-who-are-a-little-old-man-on-the-inside"> Read More...</a></span></p>
